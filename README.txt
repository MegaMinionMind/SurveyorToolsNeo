A question might arise about why the manual is for Release 1 and the project file is R4 or later.  The quick answer is that it is a lot of effort to create a manual, especially the images for the manual.  Since operation of the software is the same for all versions, the original manual remains relevant.  Only things like blunder fixes, added options, and interface adjustments were made.

Release 1 was named that since it was the first time that this software was given out outside of the author's organization.  Ready or not, it went out.  Release 2 or "R2" had some minor adjustments from Release 1, but since it was posted on a forum it was given that designation because it was like the second time/version that was being released into the wild.  "R3" gets this designation because it makes a change in the file format for the lot closure program.  Older versions won't be able to read files made with this version.  Of course, it can read all the files made with the older versions.  With R4 comes several small blunder fixes, a few small added features like pick buttons for stationing text, and solutions for spiral curves.

Please note that the "spiral" elements that are placed in the .dgn aren't really spirals.  They are actually linestrings that are placed to represnt a spiral.  Microstation uses B-splines to represent spirals, but it is far beyond my abilities to work with B-splines and even farther for me to shape them into a clothoid.  These tools for spirals are very minimal since they are very rarely encountered by the author of these tools, but they are enough to calculate your baselines and check some of the spiral data.  You are out of luck if you encounter an equation station within your spiral.
